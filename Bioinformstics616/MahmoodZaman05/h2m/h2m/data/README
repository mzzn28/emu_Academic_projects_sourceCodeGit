digits.sig   Is a 1.15 M signal file which contains 72 seconds of 8kHz sampled
  speech signal. Each sample is written in 16 bits linear mode, (ie. the C
  'short' format). The file has no header and was produced on a LITTLE-ENDIAN
  system (PC typically). See h2m/ex_sprec.m concerning ways of reading this
  file from MATLAB.
  The signal consists of the same speaker uttering 12 times the 10 digits
  sequence 0 to 9 in french(!).

digits.mat   Is a V4-mat file which contains a 120x3 matrix 'segment' which
  contains on each line:
      spoken digit     first sample     last sample
  Sample indexes run from the beginning of the file.

digits.m     Is a script useful for plotting and listening each word in file
  digits.sig separately. It will only work if (1) you have already fixed the
  file format problem (see h2m/ex_sprec.m) if using a big-endian computer; (2)
  the MATLAB command sound works on your computer.

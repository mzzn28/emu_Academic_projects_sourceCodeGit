A more advance example (sequence recognition with HMM): ex_sprec
</H2>
The script <code>ex_sprec.m</code> contains a more elaborate example of the use of
<TT>H2M</TT> functions for an isolated words speaker-dependent recognition task
(with no recording variability). I included this example because it provided a
simple way of answering most of the question I was asked concerning <TT>H2M</TT> (please, don't ask me about speech recognition anymore!).  <B>I do however
  insist on the following: (1) <code>ex_sprec.m</code> is not meant to be used for
  real-world speech recognition (see section <A HREF="node13.html#sec:time+mem">2.5.3</A> on computation
  time and memory usage), (2) I am not a speech recognition expert and thus
  cannot answer questions concerning this particular use of <TT>H2M</TT>   functions</B>.

<P>
This is a very simplistic example where basic models (left-right models with
five states and a single shared covariance matrix) are sufficient to get rid of
all errors on a small size training set (which is again not at all typical of
real-world speech recognition applications). The code is commented so that it
should not be too difficult to figure out what's going on.

<P>
If you run into trouble, it will probably happens when reading the signal file
<code>data/</code> <code>digits.sig</code> which is a binary file contains shorts (16 bits
signed integers) recorded on a <EM>little-endian</EM> system (PCs running Windows
or Linux are typically little-endian systems, most Unix workstations are
big-endian). I have successfully run <code>ex_sprec</code> on various Unix systems
(little <EM>and</EM> big-endian) using either MATLAB V5 or OCTAVE 2.0, so I hope
to have cleared all the input/output problems. The script tries to determine
which of MATLAB or OCTAVE is used so as to add the <code>octave</code> subdirectory
to the search path if needed.

<P>
Running <code>ex_sprec</code> requires about 6 Mb of memory, or 15 Mb if you have to
overwrite the signal file (which is my own stupid way of coping with old
versions of MATLAB or OCTAVE running on big-endian systems). On my own Linux
box (Pentium III - 1 GHz hardarwe), the computation time for <code>ex_sprec</code>
(parameterization, training and recognition) ranges from 48.5 s under OCTAVE to
9.1 s using MATLAB with all computational routines compiled.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>What follows is a remark that could be useful for people needing to
    adapt the code to a new type of model rather than an actual wishlist since
    I don't plan to to this myself at the moment.</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If you take a look at the code in <code>nbh_em</code>, <code>ph_em</code> or <code>pm_em</code>
and compare these with the corresponding functions for multivariate Gaussian
state conditional distributions (<code>mix</code>, <code>hmm</code>, etc) you will se that
they are all very similar and that one could indeed develop generic routines
for EM estimation of mixtures and HMMs. The only model specific elements that
are needed are

<OL>
<LI>A routine that compute the density values given the data and the
  parameters characterizing the different model states (this is done by the
  function <code>gauseval</code> for multivariate Gaussian distributions).
</LI>
<LI>A routine that updates the parameters of the state conditional
  distributions given the a posteriori state probabilities (this is done by the
  <code>hmm_dens</code> for multivariate Gaussian distributions). This second
  function can be somewhat more difficult to implement since one needs to
  consider the precise form of the EM intermediate quantity, but usually this
  just boils down to a straightforward modification of the maximum likelihood
  computation in the corresponding model (see, for instance, the end of
  <code>pm_em</code> for the case of Poisson distributions).
</LI>
</OL>
Everything else (including the forward-backward recursions and the reestimation
of the transition matrix and, if needed, of the initial states - that is
functions such as <code>hmm_fb</code>, <code>hmm_vit</code>, <code>hmm_tran</code> or
<code>mix_post</code>) is absolutely generic.

<P>
For doing this with MATLAB/OCTAVE, one would have to use <code>eval</code> statements
(so as to allow passing the names of the above two routines as parameters) as
well as variable number of input arguments (since all distributions do not have
the same number of parameters). The latter could be done easilly in MATLAB
(starting from V 5) using the <code>varargin</code> construct.
